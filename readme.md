# Summer
[Try it out](https://summer.vmasdani.my.id)

A project to sum the total price needed for your BOM list & save it in your local storage, so when you exit your browser, the data won't be lost (until you clear your browser data).

This is an attempt for me to re-learn Elm and try out IndexedDB. However the IndexedDB is not pure Elm, Javascript interop is still needed.

### Building
1. Download [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
2. Clone this directory
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vmasdani/summer
```
3. Run `build.sh`
```sh
./build.sh
```
4. The static files will be in `dist` folder.
